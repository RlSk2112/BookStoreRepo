Bookstore Project

This repository serves as a training ground for learning new technologies by gradually adding them incrementally. The primary goal is to start with Spring and basic CRUD operations, followed by the addition of a database and eventually integrating Spring Security.

Key Objectives:
1. Spring Training: Gain hands-on experience with the Spring framework.
2. CRUD Operations: Implement basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing book data. <-Current phase
3. Database Integration: Incorporate a database to persist and retrieve book information.
4. Spring Security: Enhance the project's security by integrating Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or suggestions.
